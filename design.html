              <h3>Introduce</h3>
              <p>This is the website design is about the cake shop. Use the website to display the products and services of the cake shop,
                so that more people can freely buy products on the web page.</p>

              <h3>Design Style</h3>
              <p>In this website, the main colors are pink and coffee. Pink is used as the background color and coffee color is used as the text color
                to better highlight the content. A relatively wide margin is used between each section to make the website look less crowded. The overall
                design style is biased towards cuteness, and the font also uses a rounder font. Because most of the people buying cakes are mainly women,
                it can attract more customers to browse the website. </p>

              <h3>Analyze</h3>
              <p>The cake website needs to reflect what services and products can be provided,and we must design a service list with a clear
                hierarchical structure. For example, use a carousel in homepage can let the users able to see the new products once they enter the site. At the same time,
                several important sections have been designed on the homepage and can be linked to subpages for more detailed understanding. In the product list,
                On the product detail page, you can not only see the detailed introduction of this cake or drink, but also the recommendations of other products.
                We also need to consider that the website can be displayed perfectly on different screens,so we also need to have different responsive designs.
                For the screen that is too small, we need to change some pictures and menus.</p>

                <h3>Feedback</h3>
              <p>This project was completed by me and another partner. I am quite satisfied with this project, and realized some interesting interactive designs,
                such as a carousel. At the same time, the company's service navigation and product list are given in detail.</p>

              <h3>Introduce</h3>
              <p>This is a poster that uses a combination of graphics, angles and colors. What it expresses is a movie called <strong>Inception</strong>.</p>

              <h3>Design Style</h3>
              <p>This poster is relatively simple in terms of color and graphics. The main content is to express the movie to the audience through four different colors.
                Use simple design to convey information. </p>
              <h3>Analyze</h3>
              <p>The four colors represent different dreams, and the order of the colors is also from light to dark, describing the content of the entire movie.
                In the movie, the protagonist falls into a total of four levels of dreams. Each level of dreams is built on the upper level of dreams. The deeper
                the color, the deeper the dream, the harder it is to wake up. At the same time, the angle of the entire design is biased to 45 degrees, which also
                shows spatial instability.</p>
              <h3>Feedback</h3>
              <p>This poster looks simple, but it actually took us a lot of time. We use simple posters to convey more information.</p>
