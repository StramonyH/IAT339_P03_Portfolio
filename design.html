              <p>This is a website design project at IAT339 2021 spring semster for cake company named: H.F Cake.</p>

              <h3>Analysis</h3>
              <p>This means that we are not only simply designing a website, but also designing the content and services of the cake company.
                Therefore, in order to demonstrate what services and products the company can provide, we must design a list of services with a
                clear hierarchical structure. At the same time, we also need to consider that the website can be perfectly displayed on different screens,
                so different responsive designs are also needed. For the screen that is too small, we need to change some pictures and menus.</p>
